TASI-2223-114 Fake News Detection


Advances in communication technology have accelerated the spread of information, which can also give rise to disinformation or so-called fake news. Based on data released by Kominfo, there are as many as 800,000 fake news dissemination sites circulating in Indonesia. One of the efforts that can be made to reduce the spread of fake news, namely by detecting fake news. Researchers propose to use one of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, namely Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with hyperparameter tuning as an optimization in detecting fake news. The construction of models to detect fake news using BERT with hyperparameter tuning is based on the need to improve the detection capabilities of fake news in Indonesian.
